            <h1>1. Chablis</h1>
            <p>Chablis' soil is unique in the world: very old, it is composed of oyster fossils, since, in prehistory, the entire region was under the sea. However, wines vary in quality according to the vineyard in which they were produced: the closer to the center, the better the soils and wines, and the further away from the city, the worse the soils and, consequently, the wines coming from these vineyards.</p><br>
            <p>Petit Chablis are simpler and lighter wines, made to be drunk young. They are produced in a region that lies on the edge of Chablis. The Chablis AOC are the most popular and traditional of the appellation of origin. The Chablis Premiere Crus are named after one of the 40 vineyards that have this classification, while the Chablis Grand Crus, the most premium classification in the region, are produced in just seven vineyards.</p>

            <h1>2. Chardonnays from California</h1>
            <p>Chardonnay is the most widely cultivated white grape variety in California, especially in the colder regions and expresses more balance than oak. Known for its notes of green apple, fig and citrus flavors, California Chardonnays have high acidity and complex aromas. However, Californian white wines usually pass by Aging in oak barrels, they also gain toasted, vanilla and butter notes.</p><br>
            <p>Chardonnay cultivation in California dates back to the 1800s, although always limited due to the low yield of the variety. During Prohibition in the USA, much of the vineyards were uprooted, but the vineyards of Vale Livermore and Santa Cruz Mountains managed to survive. It was from the 1970s and 80s, however, that the cultivation of Chardonnay grew with the popularization of its wines in the American market with the boom of white wines.</p>

            <h1>3. Riesling from Alsace</h1>
            <p>Alsace is one of the most important and respected producing regions in France, a fact evidently linked to the undeniable quality of its wines. However, it is a peculiar region, due to several and distinct cultural aspects. Alsace uses elongated bottles for wines, similar to the German ones, and the wines are almost always labeled as varietals, clearly informing the grape used there on the label. , an uncommon fact among the many producing regions of that country.</p><br>
            <p>Even the style of the wines brings their similarities. Alsace has hot, dry summers, so that the wines have more body and structure than their German counterparts, but still with important freshness and elegance, in addition to special attention to the aromatic expression of the wines and the existence of the sweetest Vendanges Tardives and Sélection de Grains Nobles, another aspect also highly valued by the Germans. For many fans, Riesling is acceptable only in its French version, as a wine from Alsace, the only region in France where this German grape variety is officially allowed</p>
