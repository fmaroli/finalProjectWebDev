                <p class="parag">It all starts with the grapes. It is important that they are harvested at the right time. Neither too green nor too ripe, otherwise the wine will suffer the consequences. The harvested grapes contain the potency of wine: you can make a bad wine with good grapes; but not good wine with bad grapes.
                Harvesters go to winery. This is the exciting part of the year and all producers expect good weather conditions during the harvest. Bad weather can ruin everything. The harvested grapes are placed in a car so that they can be transported. Increasingly the grapes are being harvested mechanically, because of a better cost-benefit ratio. In hot regions, quality can be preserved if the harvest is carried out at night, when the climate is milder, which allows the use of technology.</p>
                <p class="parag">The machine pulls the grape berry out of the vineyard. Then, pour them into boxes to go to the cellar. These are the grapes cut by the machine undergoing a quality control process. The fruits harvested by hand arrive at the cellar in whole bunches.</p>
                <div class="storyHighlight">
                    The grapes are selected manually according to their quality. Any ripe or rotten grapes, along with leaves and petioles, are removed.
                </div>
                <p class="parag">The grapes go to a machine that removes their stems. This is the reception area of a small cellar. Here the grapes are carried on a conveyor belt and taken to a tank in which they will be pumped into a fermentation vessel. Here is the moment when red wine differs from whites. Red wines are fermented together with the skin, while white wines are pressed and have their juice separated from the skin before fermentation. This fermentation vessel - in a shallow stone - will be completely filled so that the grapes can be trodden. In this way the juice can extract the color and other components of the peel.
                The purple grapes were trampled and the fermentation started naturally. These men are mixing the skin with the juice manually. This process is carried out numerous times a day to help with the extraction and also to stop the bacteria from growing and not prevent the shells from floating. Sometimes yeasts are added in their dry form to give the wine producer greater control. about the fermentation process. But many fermentations are still made with wild yeasts, naturally present in the vineyard or cellar.</p>
                <p class="parag">These purple grapes are being fermented in a stainless steel tank. During fermentation, carbon dioxide is released and therefore the possibility of opening the tank. Sometimes, however, fermentation takes place in closed tanks with only holes that allow the gas to escape. In this small tank the shells are being pushed down with the use of a mechanical arm. In some wineries this is done by hand using stakes. An alternative way to sink them is to pour wine from the bottom of the tank on top of the shells.</p>
                <p class="parag">Here, the fermentation of red wine is being pumped out of the tank and pumped back. The idea is to introduce oxygen to help the yeast grow. At another stage of manufacture it is necessary to protect it from oxygen, but at this stage this gas is necessary. When fermentation is complete, most red wines are placed in barrels to complete their maturation. The barrels vary in shape and size. Above, the most common size: from 225 to 250 liters. The quality of the oak (and whether the barrel was previously used or not) is important for the effects that will be produced during the development of the wine. This is a much larger and older barrel. It practically does not give the wine an oak aspect. Which matches best with some types of drink.
                This is a pressure basket: when completely fermented and drained, the shells and stems are pressed to extract the rest of the wine they may contain. This is a type of press used for some red wines and for most whites. A large air-filled bladder presses the contents gently and evenly due to its gradual increase in size. This is what is left over at the end of the process and can be used as fertilizer. The inside of the tank that was used to ferment white wine. The residue consists of dead yeast cells. Barrel rooms can look quite traditional. </p>
                <p class="parag">Underground spaces are perfect for wine maturation - a process that lasts from six months to three years. Winemakers check the maturation of red wine at regular intervals. Part of the drink may evaporate during this process. Occasionally it is necessary to move the wine from one barrel to another, or from one barrel to a stainless steel tank. This winery is using nitrogen gas to move the wine without overexposing it to oxygen. Here the wine is being moved from one barrel to another and being deliberately exposed to oxygen in order to assist in the ripening process. Some wines have no contact with oak and are kept in stainless steel tanks to preserve its fruitful characteristics fresh.Finally, the wine is ready and prepared for bottling. Often filtration is used to keep the wine shiny and translucent, removing any microbiotic residue. In the cup on the left the drink was filtered; on the right, you can see what the wine looks like before the process.
