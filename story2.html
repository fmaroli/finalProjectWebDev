                <p class="parag">It all starts with the grapes. It is important that they are harvested at the right time. Neither too green nor too ripe, otherwise the wine will suffer the consequences. The harvested grapes contain the potency of wine: you can make a bad wine with good grapes; but not good wine with bad grapes.
                It starts when harvesters go to winery. It's the exciting part of the year and all producers expect good weather conditions during the harvest. Bad weather can ruin everything. The harvested grapes are placed in a car so that they can be transported. The amount of grapes that are being harvested mechanically is increasing, because of a better cost-benefit ratio. In hot regions, quality can be preserved if the harvest is carried out at night, when the climate is milder, which allows the use of technology.</p>
                <p class="parag">The machine pulls the grape berry out of the vineyard. Then, pour them into boxes to go to the cellar. Then the grapes undergo a quality control process. The fruits harvested by hand arrive at the cellar in whole bunches.</p>
                <div class="storyHighlight">
                    The grapes are selected manually according to their quality. Any ripe or rotten grapes, along with leaves and petioles, are removed.
                </div>
                <p class="parag">The grapes then go to a machine that removes their stems. Then the grapes are carried on a conveyor belt and taken to a tank in which they will be pumped into a fermentation vessel. This is the moment where red wine differs from whites. Red wines are fermented together with the skin, while white wines are pressed and have their juice separated from the skin before fermentation. The fermentation vessel will be completely filled so that the grapes can be pressed. In this way the juice can extract the color and other components of the peel.
                The purple grapes were pressed and the fermentation started naturally. Then the must and skin needs to be mixed. This process is carried out numerous times a day to help with the extraction and also to stop bacteria from growing and prevent shells from floating. Sometimes yeast is added in their dry form to give the wine producer greater control. But many are still made with wild yeasts, naturally present in the vineyard or cellar.</p>
                <p class="parag">The grapes are then fermented in a stainless steel tank. During fermentation, carbon dioxide is released and therefore the necessity of an opening in the tank. Sometimes, however, fermentation takes place in closed tanks  only with small holes that allow the gas to escape.</p>
                <p class="parag">Then the fermented red wine is pumped out and back in. The idea is to introduce oxygen to help the yeast grow. At another stage of manufacture, it is necessary to protect it from oxygen, but at this stage it is necessary. When fermentation is complete, most red wines are placed in barrels to complete their maturation. The barrels vary in shape and size. The most common size is from 225 to 250 liters. The quality of the oak (and whether the barrel was previously used or not) is important for the effects that will be produced during the development of the wine.
                Then, the wine go to a pressure basket: when completely fermented and drained, the shells and stems are pressed to extract the rest of the wine they may contain. A large air-filled bladder presses the contents gently and evenly due to its gradual increase in size.</p>
                <p class="parag">Underground spaces are perfect for wine maturation, a process that lasts from six months to three years. Winemakers check the maturation of red wine at regular intervals. Part of the drink may evaporate during this process. Occasionally it is necessary to move the wine from one barrel to another, or from one barrel to a stainless steel tank. Some wineries use nitrogen gas to move the wine without overexposing it to oxygen. Some wines have no contact with oak and are kept in stainless steel tanks to preserve its fruitful characteristics. Finally, the wine is ready and prepared for bottling. Often filtration is used to keep the wine shiny and translucent, removing any microbiotic residue.
