                <p class="parag">Clos, the famous walled vineyards of Burgundy, are worshiped. Still in the Middle Ages, the monks who settled in the region began to discover which lands produced the best wines and, to delimit some, they built small stone walls. Thus, the first Clos appeared.</p>
                <p class="parag">Clos de Vougeot is one of the largest Grand Cru vineyards in Burgundy, along with Corton and Echézeaux, covering 50 hectares. With such an area, one of its particularities is having a huge number of owners (more than 80). Most of them have about 0.2 hectare of land. Altogether, the vineyard produces about 17 thousand cases of wine and, because it is so vast and has so many producers, the wines also tend to be very different</p>
                <div class="storyHighlight">
                    The Château du Clos de Vougeot was erected in the Renaissance, around 1551
                </div>
                <p class="parag">The building that today attracts thousands of tourists and is located in the northwest part of the vineyard, the Château de Clos de Vougeot, was erected at the time of the Renaissance, around 1551, and, for years, received distinguished visitors, such as King Louis XIV, that would have come to be treated when his private doctor indicated him wines from Côtes de Nuits.
                The Cistercian order remained the sole owner of the vineyard for seven centuries, until 1789, when, during the French Revolution, the place was taken as a “national asset”. Interestingly, however, instead of dividing it as it did with most church land, Clos de Vougeot was sold as a single installment by revolutionaries</p>
                <p class="parag">With such an area, Clos de Vougeot is one of the most heterogeneous vineyards in the region. The soil structure is complex and variable depending on the location. The best parts are said to be higher up, close to the Château and the border with the Grand Crus de Grands chézeaux and Musigny, where the soils are stony and limestone.</p>
                <p class="parag">In the middle part, the soil is already a mixture of limestone and clay, with less pebbles. The lower part, in turn, has more alluvial soils with worse drainage. Some say, however, that the vineyard has at least six different soil types.</p>
