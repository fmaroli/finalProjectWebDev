                <p class="parag">Burgundy wines are charming and, for some connoisseurs, the best in the world. For many, however, they are a mystery. There are hundreds of names of appellations and producers, and deciphering what may be behind each label is not always so obvious, especially for those not used to Burgundian wines. So, to help you better understand Burgundy and its nuances, we have put together a small guide with things that every oenophile needs to know in order to better enjoy the wines of this charming French region that covers 28,000 hectares, which represents only 3% of France's vineyards.</p>
                <p class="parag">Although most of the time it is not written on the label, a red from Burgundy almost 100% of the time will be made only with Pinot Noir and a white will be a monovarietal from Chardonnay. In Burgundy, 48% of the grapes planted are Chardonnay, 34% Pinot Noir, 10% Gamay and 6% Aligoté. The other 2% are of even rarer varieties such as Sauvignon, Caesar, Pinot Beurot, Sacy, Melon and others.</p>
                <div class="storyHighlight">
                    Burgundy has no less than 100 recognized designations of origin, which represents more than 20% of the designations of origin across France
                </div>
                <p class="parag">These denominations are divided into four levels. The highest is the Grand Cru vineyards, they are 33 and represent less than 1% of the territory. Then come the Premier Cru vineyards, which account for 10% of Burgundy wines. Next come the so-called Village wines, which represent 44 more comprehensive appellations that are named after the villages they surround, and represent 37% of the local wines. Finally, there are the more generic denominations, called regional, which are 23 and are equivalent to 52% of the Burgundian wines produced.</p>
                <p class="parag">In any list of the most valued wines in the world there will certainly be several representatives of Burgundy. In a list launched annually by a specialized website, seven of the 10 most expensive wines in the world are Burgundian. Who usually tops the list? The mythical Romanée-Conti. And why are they always among the most expensive? Because, in addition to being good, many of them are extremely rare, with minuscule productions, which makes the demand take prices to the heights, often reaching figures of four or five digits in dollars.</p>
                <p class="parag">There are those who forget, but Chablis is also part of Burgundy. Because it is not in the wake of appellations to the south of Dijon, but to the west, and also because it produces only Chardonnay whites, this region is often underestimated. However, Chablis is an important part, with seven vineyards considered Grand Cru and as many Premier Cru. The territory has one of the most calcareous soils in the region, with traces of marine fossils and its wines are among the most long-lived whites in the world. It is also worth remembering that Chablis is surrounded by another lesser known region called Grand Auxerrois, which produces wines of more diverse styles in regional appellations. Also north of Dijon is another lesser-known region, called Châtillonnais, which basically produces Crémant.</p>
