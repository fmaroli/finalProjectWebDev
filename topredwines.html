            <h1>1. Domaine de la Romanee-Conti</h1>
            <p>Arguably the most important and mythical wine producer in the world, the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti (DRC) has 29 hectares of vineyards, mainly with Grand Cru status, in Côtes de Nuits and Côtes de Beaune, in Burgundy, France. It is from there that real jewels come out that justify its reputation. Since 1942. all vineyards are maintained according to the precepts of biodynamics and minimum intervention, respecting the soil, its balance and the philosophy that the role of the wine maker is to portray and translate the quality of the wine as faithfully as possible. terroir.</p>

            <h1>2. Amarone - Giuseppe Quintarelli</h1>
            <p>The Quintarello winery, which dates back to 1924, is considered by many to be the best producer of Amarone della Valpolicella. It is sold at a value equivalent to or greater than great Bordeaux wines, with an important detail: they are not produced every year. In addition, its production is very limited and having access to a bottle is something very rare.</p><br>

            <h1>3. Sierra Cantabria </h1>
            <p>DOCa Rioja is one of the most important macro-regions and was the first to receive DOCa status, in 1991. The vineyards are planted at altitudes ranging between 500 and 800 meters above sea level. The soils are limestone-clayey, with a good concentration of iron. Rioja Alavesa is west of the city of Logroño, on the north bank of the river Ebro. The vineyards are 800 m above sea level, on predominantly limestone-sandy soils and the wines produced there are probably the most subtle and elegant in Rioja. The climates in Rioja Alta and Rioja Alavesa are quite similar. Due to the influence of the Atlantic, extreme temperatures typical of continental climates do not occur.</p><br>
            <p>Traditionally, Rioja producers defined their wines by blending and using wood, with aging in barrels for longer periods than those established nationally. From the 1970s, Rioja wines started to be produced with long periods of maceration, followed by shorter stages in wood. In addition, the formerly most used American oak has been replaced by French systematically. Currently, the trend is to produce varietals and even wines made with grapes from a single vineyard, as the focus has been on showing the personality of the grape and the vineyard itself, instead of techniques for making good blends. More modern Riojas already have more fruity traits and are more influenced by French oak barrels.</p>
